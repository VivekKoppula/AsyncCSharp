Whenever you have a task, you pretty much always want to await that in the same method, mainly because it will give you the result of the asynchronous operation, but it will also make sure that the call was completed successfully and that there were no exceptions. We will return the decentralized list of stock prices to the view, which will then be processed. And finally, the client that called this ASP.NET website will get a result. Running this gives an interesting result. Using async and await in ASP.NET does not make the client asynchronous. It might seem like it's a little bit different from how it worked in the Windows application. It took a little while to load the stock data, and you did notice that it wasn't, in fact, an asynchronous operation from the client's point of view. Then, what's the point of using async and await on the server? The big benefit of using async and await inside ASP.NET is to relieve the web server from work. The web server can then go ahead and work with other requests as data is being loaded from disk, the database, memory, or from another API.
